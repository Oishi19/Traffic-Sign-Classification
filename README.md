# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Traffic Sign Classification

This dataset is a collection of images sorted by types of Traffic signals. 
This dataset is made available by the German Trafific Department from https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
The task is to create an image classifier to classify and identify which class a traffic sign belongs to.
I have created three datasets here with mentioned classes as they were not specified in the .csv file
* Training (from the 'data/train' directory): For training purposes
* Validation (from the 'data/train' directory): For validating the performance of model while training
* Testing (from the 'data/test' directory): For testing the performance of the model on unseen data for giving a lower bound on model's performance.
